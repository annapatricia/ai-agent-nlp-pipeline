# 🤖 AI Agent + NLP Extraction Pipeline

Prototype of an **AI agent designed to transform unstructured text into structured data** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a modular, reproducible pipeline.

The project demonstrates how an AI agent can ingest raw textual data, apply preprocessing and extraction logic, and generate structured outputs suitable for analytics, reporting, or downstream automation.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Ingest unstructured text data  
- Apply NLP-based preprocessing and information extraction  
- Orchestrate the process through an agent-style pipeline  
- Generate structured outputs (JSON / CSV) automatically  
- Provide a clean, extensible architecture for AI agents

## 🧠 Conceptual Overview

This project simulates a **real-world AI agent workflow**, where raw text (e.g. documents, reports, messages) is converted into structured information through:

1. Data ingestion  
2. Text preprocessing  
3. NLP-based extraction  
4. Agent orchestration logic  
5. Structured output generation  

The architecture is intentionally modular, enabling future integration with:
- LLMs
- External APIs
- Vector databases
- Workflow orchestrators
- Cloud-based pipelines
